# Git commits

Follow the steps strictly. Proceed to the next step only after completing or explicitly skipping the current step.

## Configuration

Read preferences from the current request, project configuration, or global configuration. Precedence:

1. Current user request
2. Project configuration: `.agents/config/pr-commit.config.json`, `.claude/config/pr-commit.config.json`
3. Global configuration: `~/.agents/config/pr-commit.config.json`, `~/.claude/config/pr-commit.config.json`
4. Default values

Supported fields:

| Field | Type | Description | Default |
| - | - | - | - |
| `gitUser.name` | `string` / `null` | Expected Git username | `null` |
| `gitUser.email` | `string` / `null` | Expected Git email | `null` |
| `coAuthors` | `string` / `string[]` / `null` | One or more co-authors, with each item containing only `<name> <email>` | `null` |

Single co-author configuration:

```json
{
  "coAuthors": "Zero <zero@vm0.ai>"
}
```

Multiple co-author configuration:

```json
{
  "coAuthors": [
    "Zero <zero@vm0.ai>",
    "Moxt <noreply@moxt.ai>"
  ]
}
```

Do not include the fixed `Co-Authored-By: ` prefix in configuration values. When `coAuthors` is configured, normalize a string to a single-item list and generate `Co-Authored-By: <name> <email>` for each item in configuration order. Do not append co-authors inferred from the current agent. When it is not configured, retain the default behavior of inferring a co-author from the current agent.

If the user temporarily overrides configuration in a request, ask whether to save it after completing the work. When saving, prefer `.agents/config/pr-commit.config.json` unless the user specifies another agent directory. Do not commit configuration containing personal information to version control.

## Workflow

### 1. Check the environment

- Confirm that the current directory is a Git repository.
- Check `git config user.name` and `git config user.email`.
- Check only configured `gitUser` fields: validate `user.name` when `gitUser.name` is configured, and validate `user.email` when `gitUser.email` is configured. Do not require unconfigured fields. Stop and provide remediation commands when a configured field is missing or does not match.
- When `gitUser.name` is not configured, derive the user identifier for the feature branch name in this order:
  1. The current `git config user.name`
  2. The login of the account currently authenticated with `gh`, retrieved with `gh api user --jq '.login'`
- If neither method provides a user identifier, ask the user. Do not silently write Git configuration.
- Distinguish forked from non-forked repositories before choosing the PR target:
  - First use `git remote -v` to check for an `upstream` remote. If it exists, treat the repository as a fork and use the repository associated with `upstream` as the original repository.
  - If there is no `upstream`, use `gh repo view --json isFork,parent,nameWithOwner` to check whether the current `origin` is a GitHub fork. When `isFork` is `true`, use `parent.nameWithOwner` as the original repository.
  - Determine fork status from either the presence of an `upstream` remote or the `isFork` value returned by `gh repo view`: `true` means forked and `false` means non-forked.

### 2. Analyze changes

- Analyze changes with `git status`, `git diff`, and `git diff --cached`.
- If the user adds or modifies workspace content during execution, restart from this step.
- Split unrelated topics into separate commits. Do not include unrelated changes in the same commit.

### 3. Handle the branch

- Use a feature branch by default. Do not commit directly to `main`.
- Name feature branches `<user-name>-<short-description>` in kebab-case. Use the user identifier determined during the environment check for `<user-name>`.
- Keep history linear. Use `git pull --rebase` and do not create merge commits.

### 4. Create commits

- Stage the files needed for the commit with `git add`.
- Write commit messages in English using Angular Conventional Commits (optional with scope):
  - Example: `feat: add article formatter`, `chore(skills): update fetch article skill`
- Do not amend existing commits. Create a new commit.
- Add co-authors at the end of the commit body:
  - When `coAuthors` is configured, append every `Co-Authored-By: <name> <email>` trailer generated from the configuration.
  - When it is not configured, infer the co-author from the current agent:
    - Claude: `Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>`
    - Codex: `Co-Authored-By: Codex <noreply@openai.com>`
    - If the current agent cannot be determined, ask the user or skip the co-author and explain why.

### 5. Push and create a PR

- Push automatically after creating a commit.
- Write PR titles in English using Angular Conventional Commits (optional with scope):
  - Example: `feat: add article formatter`, `chore(skills): update fetch article skill`
- If a push fails because of a non-fast-forward update:
  1. Run `git pull --rebase`
  2. If conflicts occur, identify the conflicting files and resolve them or wait for the user to handle them
  3. After the rebase completes, use `git push --force-with-lease`
- If `--force-with-lease` fails, do not use `--force` directly. Explain the risk and ask the user first.
- If the current branch is a feature branch without a PR, create one by default. Skip PR creation only when the user explicitly requests a commit without a PR.
  - Forked repository: push the feature branch to your fork, then create a cross-repository PR against the original repository with `gh pr create --repo <upstream-owner>/<upstream-repo> --head <fork-owner>:<feature-branch>`. You do not need to switch to the original repository owner's identity.
  - Non-forked repository: push the current feature branch, then use `gh pr create` to open a PR against the current repository.
- State in the PR description that rebase merge is the default and request deletion of the feature branch after merge.
- When `coAuthors` is configured, append every generated `Co-Authored-By: <name> <email>` trailer to the end of the PR description. When it is not configured, do not append inferred co-authors to the PR description.
- Link any related issue in the PR.

### 6. Track the PR

- After creating or finding a PR, give the user its link.
- Track check and review status with `gh pr checks` and `gh pr view`.
- If a check fails:
  1. Summarize the failed job and key errors
  2. Fix the problem
  3. Create a new commit and push it by following the commit workflow, then continue tracking the PR
- If a review raises a serious issue:
  1. Summarize the issue
  2. Determine whether it is real, reasonable, and requires a fix, and explain the evidence
  3. Ask the user whether to fix or reject it
  4. If fixing it, create a new commit and continue tracking. If rejecting it, dismiss the review and provide a reason
- If a serious issue has been fixed but review was skipped, trigger another review using the reviewer's convention, such as commenting `@codex review`.

### 7. Merge the PR

- After PR checks and reviews have no issues, ask the user whether to merge automatically.
- If the user chooses not to merge, stop here.
- If the user chooses to merge:
  - Prefer the merge queue when the project has one enabled
  - Use rebase merge by default, preserving every commit and its complete message and co-author trailers
  - Use squash merge only when the user explicitly requests it or when the PR contains multiple small temporary commits that should be compressed
    - When using squash merge, preserve all required `Co-Authored-By` trailers in the squash commit body
  - Do not use a merge commit, to avoid branches in `main` history
  - Wait for the PR to merge successfully
  - Confirm that the remote feature branch has been deleted
  - If there is a related issue, confirm that it has been closed
  - If a preview environment exists, provide the latest preview link

## Critical rules

- Use the `gh` CLI to manage PRs.
- Keep history linear by default.
- Use rebase merge by default to preserve every commit and its co-author information.
- Do not commit directly to `main`.
- Do not amend commits.
- Write PR titles and commit messages in English using Angular Conventional Commits (optional with scope).
- Handle Git errors properly and explain the cause, impact, and next step.
